# Acid Breakout

## About

A recreation of the game [Acid Breakout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIlTXTbd7FY) implemented in TypeScript using WebGL. This recreation was made as a part of one of my assignments for [CSE160: Introduction to Computer Graphics](https://courses.engineering.ucsc.edu/courses/cse160) at University of California, Santa Cruz but I have
since separated it out into its own project here.

## How to Play

The game can be played [here](https://sirius902.github.io/acid-breakout).
